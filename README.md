April 2016

Life of Py is a life and evolution simulation game written in Python and using the Pyglet library for graphics. Nearly all of the assets in the game are procedurally generated using fractals, cellular automata, and other randomizing techniques.


## INSTALLATION
In order to run the game, the following items must be installed:

* Python 3
* Pyglet
* Numpy

These are most easily installed using Python's native pip package manager

## HOW TO RUN
Simply start the game with the command 'python Main.py' in the terminal or otherwise.

## HELP
There are many ways in which the user can interact with the virtual environment in the game
* At the lower left are time control buttons (pause, speed up, slow down)
* At the lower middle are buttons which open menus for creating creatures/species and viewing and altering
* At the lower right is the button to switch into immersive 3D mode
* Right click to pan
* Left click to select
* When a single creature is selected, a menu shows that allows many creature parameters to be changed
